## PAU: Design and Implementation of Posit-Based Vector Arithmetic Unit for Low-Power Platforms
### Abstract:
In the context of the rapid development of edge computing, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and big data processing, the traditional IEEE 754 floating-point system faces limitations in precision and efficiency, particularly in specific application scenarios where high energy consumption and precision loss are prominent. To address these challenges, the Posit number system has gained attention due to its adaptive precision distribution, broader dynamic range, and lower hardware resource consumption, making it particularly advantageous in resource-constrained edge computing environments. However, despite its theoretical advantages, existing research primarily focuses on scalar computation models, which result in performance bottlenecks during large-scale parallel data processing. This paper presents a Posit Vector Processing Unit (PVU) designed in Chisel, which processes multiple data sets in parallel and supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and dot product, overcoming the limitations of traditional scalar designs. Combined with customized RISC-V instruction extensions, this research achieves higher computational performance and energy efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the Posit number system outperforms IEEE 754 in terms of precision, speed, and energy efficiency, highlighting its potential advantages in various application scenarios. The contributions of this work include the efficient implementation of the vector processing unit, parameterized and modular hardware design, customized RISC-V instruction support, and practical application validation of the Posit system, providing an innovative solution for the next generation of floating-point computations in edge computing applications.
