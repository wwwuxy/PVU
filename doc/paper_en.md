## PAU: Design and Implementation of Posit-Based Vector Arithmetic Unit for Low-Power Platforms
### Abstract:
In the context of the rapid development of edge computing, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and big data processing, the traditional IEEE 754 floating-point system faces limitations in precision and efficiency, particularly in certain specialized applications where high energy consumption and significant precision loss are evident. To address these issues, the Posit number system has gained attention due to its adaptive precision distribution, broader dynamic range, and lower hardware resource consumption. However, research on Posit-based floating-point hardware is limited, with most studies focusing on scalar computation models, which create performance bottlenecks in large-scale parallel data processing. This paper presents a Posit Vector Processing Unit (PVU) designed in Chisel, which processes multiple data sets in parallel and supports arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and dot product. This design overcomes the limitations of traditional scalar approaches. Combined with customized RISC-V instruction extensions, this research achieves higher computational performance and energy efficiency. Experimental results show that the Posit number system outperforms IEEE 754 in terms of precision, speed, and energy consumption, demonstrating its potential for various applications. The contributions of this work include the efficient implementation of the vector processing unit, parameterized and modular hardware design, customized RISC-V instruction support, and the practical application verification of the Posit system, providing an innovative solution for the next generation of floating-point computations in edge computing.Design and Implementation of Posit-Based Vector Arithmetic Unit (PVU) for Low-Power Platforms
